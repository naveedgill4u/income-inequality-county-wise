Gni Index, Table B19083 contains data of Income Inequality in U.S. Census Burea collects data through American Community Survey. ACS data is available on yearly basis survey and five year basis survey.\nI am deeply thankful to ** Preceptor ** for organizing Free Data Science Camp and guiding to access data from American Community Survey for using in this project.\nI have used AI tools for analysis and data wrengling.\nYou can approach to me through emailNaveed Ahmad.

    "text": "Summary\n\nUnited Nation has set through SDG 10 to minimize gap of income inequality among people for sustainable development. Income inequality is burning issue for all nations around the globe. I have examined income inequality in U.S by using data from American Community Servey (ACS) 2020. Gini Index table has the data of income inequality, index value 0.4 and above means income inequality. First, EDA was conducted. Then, liner regression model predicted the income inequality as function of income, poverty, and unemployment rate. The predictions are based upon some assumptions, if there is change in income, poverty and unemployment rate due to reforms or other opportunities, the actual results may vary. The income inequality (Gini Index) in U.S is predicted to be 0.48, with a 95% CI of 0.46 to 0.48 in most of the counties."
