Gni Index, Table B19083 contains data of Income Inequality in U.S. Census Burea collects data through American Community Survey. ACS data is available on yearly basis survey and five year basis survey. I am deeply thankful to ** Preceptor ** for organizing Free Data Science Camp and guiding to access data from American Community Survey for using in this project.\nYou can approach to me through emailNaveed Ahmad.

    "text": "United Nation has set through SDG 10 to minimize gap of income inequality among people for sustainable development. Income inequality is burning issue for all nations around the glob. In this document, I have explained a picture of income inequality in U.S by using data from American Community Servey (ACS) 2020. Gini Index table has the data of income inequality. Income Inequality (gini) has link with many social indicators however, in this study, outcome variable is gini with covariates; income, poverty, education rate and umemployment rate in U.S. First, EDA was conducted. Then, liner regression model was used to predict the income inequlaity as function of income, poverty, and unemployment rate. The predictions of this study are based upon some assumptios, for example, if there is chnage in income, poverty and unemployment rate due to reforms or other opportunities, the future results may be different. The intercept shows that holding other things constant, income inequality (Gini Index) is predicted to be 0.475 with variation from 0.468 to 0.481"

    "text": "1. Explanatory Data Analysis\n\nIncrese in Education and Income had reduced income inequality whereas, increse in unemployment and poverty had incresed income inequality. The relationship among income inequality (gini) and other social indicators can be seen in plot. Log of income and poverty were taken for better comparision purpose. Further, Histograms of every indicator can also be seen in dignal which shows that distributions of gini, log income, log poverty are normal but distributions of education rate and unemployment rate are slightly and significantly right skewed respectively."
