<div style="text-align: justify;">I am expert in Audit, Accounts, Finance and student of Data Analysis. I hold Master of Philosophy degree in Business Management with elective as Finance. I do love Data Analysis. I have prepared this project as an assignment of the free learning Data Science Camp. 

I am deeply thankful to **Preceptor** for guiding and organizing [*Free Data Science Camp*](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info/). 

You can approach to me through email[*Naveed Ahmad*](naveedgill4u@yahoo.com). You can also visit me at [Git hub](https://github.com/naveedgill4u) to see my work about Data Analysis.
